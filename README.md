### 👋 Hey there! I'm Akhil Krishna R

I'm an astrophysicist turned data scientist — basically, I spend a lot of time wrangling galaxies and gigabytes. I recently wrapped up my PhD at Christ University, where I studied how galaxies form and evolve using data from telescopes like **UVIT**, **JWST**, **HST**, **CFHT**, and **DECaLS**, and simulations from the likes of **TNG50**.

I love building data pipelines, visualizing cosmic structures, and throwing machine learning at high-dimensional problems (sometimes it even works 😄). I'm most comfortable in **Python**, but I’ve also dabbled in **C/C++**, **R**, and a bit of **Bash scripting**.

### 🛠️ What I Do
- 🔭 Analyze multi-wavelength telescope data (UV to IR)
- 🤖 Apply ML for galaxy classification & modeling
- 🧪 Build reproducible analysis pipelines for large datasets
- 🧠 Explore simulations to understand galaxies
- 📈 Visualize complex data in clean, intuitive plots

### 🌌 Fun Stuff
- 💬 I’ve published in journals like *ApJ*, *MNRAS*, and *A&A*
- 🌏 Presented my work in **Japan** and **Australia**
- 🎮 When I’m not coding or stargazing, you’ll find me gaming, movie-watching, or geeking out over new tech
